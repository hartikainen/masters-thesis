We have spent lots of time trying to figure out the problems with the experiment hardware. The OCTEON II blades drop the received packets and deadlock unexpectedly. We are waiting to get answers for these issues in a week or two.

I'm still waiting for the official bachelor's degree graduation, needed to get the master level study plan approved. The graduation date is 31st of August.
