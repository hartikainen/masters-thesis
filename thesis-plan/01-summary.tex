In this thesis, we will measure the performance of a multi-blade network processing system, and create a simulation model based on those measurements. The simulation model is used to understand limitations of such a system and its suitability as stream computing platform. We hope to understand how event driven programming models, such as OpenEM, could be extended to support inter-node load balancing in this context.

The measurements will be done on a system consisting of 8 Cavium Octeon II, 32 MIPS core blades, connected over ethernet switch to each other. The emphasis of the measurements will be on the communication delays between the blades.

The system will be modeled using Performance Simulation Environment (PSE).
