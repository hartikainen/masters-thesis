The load-balancing of the dynamic data-stream will be transformed into a task scheduling problem. This will be achieved by extending OpenEM type of processing queue mechanism by MPI's inter-node task scheduling. The actual experiment will not include a full implementation of either OpenEM or MPI, but their characteristics will be measured by experimenting with isolated parts of those systems.

The results of the experiments will be evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. The experiment will be implemented on a system consisting of 8 Cavium OCTEON II blades, each consisting of 32 MIPS cores. Because the hardware system is sort of a black box, our focus will be heavily on the quantitative results and simulation. Program analysis will be done both statically and dynamically. The main simulation tool will be Performation Simulation Environment (PSE). The analysis results will be compared to the actual measurements of the experiment system.
