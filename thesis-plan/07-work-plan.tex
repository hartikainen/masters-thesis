The work plan for the thesis consists of five major steps, that can be summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
\item Study the material needed to create the experiment
\item Build a simulation model of the system
\item Measure the needed attributes from the example hardware and software
\item Plug in the attributes to the simulation model
\item Run simulations
\item Validate that the simulations correspond the hardware system
\end{enumerate}

In step 0 we have studied existing message passing systems (MPI, future and promise constructs), event based programming models (OpenEM) and the example network processing unit. We are currently working on step 1, during which we will build a simulation model with PSE. The high level model has already been built, however the packet scheduling and applications still need to be improved.

In step 2, we will instrument and measure the needed attributes from the example hardware system. Main interest will be on the communication and memory latencies. We will begin the measurements right after we overcome the packet dropping and deadlocking problems of the system.

Then, in step 3, the measurement attributes will be plugged in the simulation model. Finally, the simulations will be run and further tests are done to validate correct behavior of the simulation model. The experiment will be reiterated, while need be, and the resources are sufficient, starting from step 1.
