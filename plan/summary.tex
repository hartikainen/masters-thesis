This document is meant to cover all the general stuff that needs to be considered before and during writing my master's thesis. In addition to the technical planning of the thesis, this plan also includes the general matters that might affect the thesis writing.

In the background section I present the outline for the larger research area where the thesis sets in. In the followed three chapters I present the goals for this thesis, the methods used to achieve those goals, and the material to be used. In the last chapters, I will go through the general matters possibly affecting the thesis writing, such as the material and resources in use, general challenges, the actual work plan, and the dissemination. In the appendix I will also present a scaffolding for the actual thesis structure, and the key literature for the thesis.
