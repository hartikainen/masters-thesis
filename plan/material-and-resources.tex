BCN/Cavium OCETON II: Mit채 t채st채 saa sanoa?

Intel DPDK: ``DPDK is a set of libraries and drivers for fast packet processing. It was designed to run on any processors knowing Intel x86 has been the first CPU to be supported. Ports for other CPUs like IBM Power 8 are under progress. It runs mostly in Linux userland. A FreeBSD port is now available for a subset of DPDK features.''

OpenEM: ``Open Event Machine (OpenEM or EM) is an architectural abstraction and framework of an event driven multicore optimized processing concept originally developed for networking. It offers an easy programming concept for scalable and dynamically load balanced multicore data plane applications with a very low overhead run-to-completion principle.''

OpenMP: ``OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is an API that supports multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming in C. OpenMP is an implementation of multithreading, a method of parallelizing whereby a master thread (a series of instructions executed consecutively) forks a specified number of slave threads and the system divides a task among them.'' Note the words shared memory.
