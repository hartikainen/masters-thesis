The Cavium OCTEON II hardware used in the experiments is going to be hard to analyze.

I haven't officially received my Bachelor's degree, since I'm one course short from it. The official degree is needed to get the Master's thesis topic approved by the school.

However, this shouldn't be a problem, as I have discussed with the student counselor Elsa Kivi-Koskinen, and the course is under progress. I have done the course exam already, and right after I finish the course project, it's done from my part. Then the Bachelor's degree still have to be approved by the school council.
