    Week 23 & Studying of the load-balancing in OpenMP/MPI systems. Figure out how to generate the workload for the experiment. Start modeling the PSE simulation. \\
    Week 24 & Continue studies of the load-balancing systems. Designing/planning of the load-balancing mechanism for our needs. Continue modeling \\
    Week 25 & Start the concrete implementation of the experiment. \\
    Week 26 & Implementing. \\
    Week 27 & First implementation of the experiment finished. Vesa and Jussi will be on a vacation and thus those vacation weeks have to be well planned. If analysis and the interpretations of the results are not finished, as is likely, then plan the exact steps for these. Plan for the next iteration. \\
    Week 28 & Work on the analysis. \\
    Week 29 & Analysis. \\
    Week 30 & Interpretation of the results for the experiment. \\
    Week 31 & Focus on writing the first iteration of the thesis. \\
    Week 32 & Thesis writing. If Vesa and Jussi are back from vacation, evaluate the experiment results. Work on the experiment according to the results. \\
    Week 33 & Thesis writing. Work on the experiment according to the results. \\
    Week 34 & Thesis writing. Work on the experiment according to the results. \\
    Week 35 & Absolute deadline for the first iteration of the experiment.  \\
    Week 36 & Figure out how to continue \\
