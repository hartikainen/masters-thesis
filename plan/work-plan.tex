Quite traditional iterative approach will be used to move forward with the experiments and thesis writing. Getting familiar with the setup of the hardware used in the experiments has been going on for the last few weeks. After the hardware setup is all clear, I will begin constructing the expertiment. The construction follows with the measurement and analysis of the construction.

After the first prototype, the last two stages, construction and analysis, will be redone according to the results of the previous iteration. As many iterations are done as are needed, within the the time I have.
