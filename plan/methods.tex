The load-balancing of the dynamic data-stream will be transformed into a task scheduling problem. This will be achieved by extending OpenEM type of processing queue mechanism by MPI's inter-node task scheduling. The actual experiment will not include any implementation of either OpenEM or MPI.

The results of the experiments will be evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. The experiment will be implemented on a system consisting of 8 Cavium Oceton II blades, each consisting of 32 MIPS cores. Because the system is sort of a black box our focus will be heavily on the quantitative results. Program analysis will be done both statically and dynamically. The main simulation (dynamic analysis) tool will be Performation Simulation Environment (PSE). The analysis results will be compared to the actual measurements of the experiment system.
