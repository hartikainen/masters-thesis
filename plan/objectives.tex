The objective of this thesis is to understand the load-balancing options of a dynamic workload of a stream computing system combining both, inter-node (shared memory) and intra-node (distributed memory), level parallelism. This objective includes constructing an experiment, that is, planning and designing, implementing, and analyzing an example of such a load-balancing system.

We hope to understand how the implemented dynamic load-balancing mechanism performs under the changing volume and requirements of a dynamic data streams, and furthermore, gain directions for further development of such a system. The experiment should reflect a real world situation of a dynamic stream processing, for the results being applicable in the further research in the field.
