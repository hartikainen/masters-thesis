I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Heikki Saikkonen, for his invaluable feedback during the final stages of writing this thesis.

Besides my supervisor, I would like to thank my instructor D.Sc. (Tech) Vesa Hirvisalo, who provided me with support and feedback throughout the project, and without whom this thesis would not have been possible.

I express my sincere gratitude to Jussi Hanhirova, who worked with me in solving many technical difficulties, provided me with insightful comments, and guided me throughout the project.

I would also like to thank my good friend Risto Vuorio, whose company, both at school and spare time, over the last few years has been invaluable for me.

Finally, I thank my family for their endless support.
