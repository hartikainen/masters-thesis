I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Heikki Saikkonen, for his invaluable feedback during the final stages of writing this thesis.

Besides my supervisor, I would like to thank my instructor D.Sc. (Tech) Vesa Hirvisalo, who provided me with support and feedback throughout the project, and without whom this thesis would not have been possible.

I express my sincere gratitude to Jussi Hanhirova, who worked with me in solving many technical difficulties, provided me with insightful comments, and helped me guide the work right from the beginning of the project.

I would also like to thank my good friend Risto Vuorio, whose company, both at school and spare time, over the last few years has been invaluable for me. He is one of the few persons who have the courage to question my doings and ability to push my goals yet higher.

Finally, I thank my family for their endless support during my life.
