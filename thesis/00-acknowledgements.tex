I would like to thank my supervisor, professor Heikki Saikkonen, for his invaluable feedback in the final stages of writing this thesis.

Besides my supervisor, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my instructor D.Sc. (Tech) Vesa Hirvisalo, who provided me with support and feedback throughout the project and without whom this thesis would not have been possible.

My thanks goes to Jussi Hanhirova, who worked with me in solving many technical difficulties, provided me with insightful comments, and helped me direct the work when needed.

Finally, I thank my good friend and fellow researcher Risto Vuori for countless hours of coworking on the theses, his accurate feedback, and all the weird jokes about Finnish inflection of nouns.
