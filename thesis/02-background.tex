% ``Cloud computing is the key mantra of todayÃ¢ÂÂs technology
% era. It caters anything as a service. It promotes resource
% sharing through internet. Eventually in cloud computing load
% balancing is a major concern used to allocate the tasks across
% several computers. Major concerns of load balancing are:
% optimal resource utilization, maximize processor throughput,
% minimize task response time, and avoid overloading''

% ``To achieve maximum throughput, in turn to improve the
% overall system performance [3], tasks can be migrated from
% overloaded nodes to lightly loaded nodes. In a cloud
% environment, to enhance the system performance workload is
% divided effectively across the participating nodes[5].There are
% two types of load balancing algorithms [9] existing such as:
% - Static Ã¢ÂÂ It is non-preemptive. The master distributes the
% workload between the slaves according to their
% performance.Once a host is allocated for a process, it
% cannot be pre-empted at run time. Here workload
% allocation is static.
% - Dynamic Ã¢ÂÂWork load is distributed at run time
% dynamically. Processes are migrated dynamically from
% over loaded nodes to under loaded nodes in order to
% keep all the nodes busy with balanced load.''

% ``Load balancing is a core networking solution responsible for distributing incoming traffic among servers hosting the same application content. By balancing application requests across multiple servers, a load balancer prevents any application server from becoming a single point of failure, thus improving overall application availability and responsiveness. For example, when one application server becomes unavailable, the load balancer simply directs all new application requests to other available servers in the pool.

% Load balancers also improve server utilization and maximize availability. Load balancing is the most straightforward method of scaling out an application server infrastructure. As application demand increases, new servers can be easily added to the resource pool, and the load balancer will immediately begin sending traffic to the new server.

% Early generation server load balancers are tried and true solutions for improving the availability and scalability of an organizationâs application infrastructure. Nonetheless, enterprises that persist in using such products run the risk of exposing themselves and their customers to increasingly poor application performance and a seemingly endless stream of application layer security threats.''

% ``Cloud computing promises to increase the velocity with which applications are deployed, enhance

% `` Hierarchical Network Layers

% The data center within the VMDC reference architecture is based on the classic multi-layer hierarchical network model. Hierarchical model benefits include scalability, resilience, performance, maintainability, and manageability and its design represents a structured approach to building the infrastructure, allowing for relatively easy expansion in modular increments. Redundant nodes and links at each level insure no single point of failure, while link aggregation can be engineered for optimal bandwidth and performance through the aggregation and core layers. In general, this hierarchical model uses three layers:

% •Core Layer—Characterized by a high degree of redundancy and bandwidth capacity and thus optimized for availability and performance.

% •Aggregation Layer—Characterized by a high degree of high-bandwidth port density capacity and thus optimized for traffic distribution and link fan-out capabilities to access layer switches. Functionally, the nodes in the aggregation layer typically serve as the Layer 2/Layer 3 boundary.

% •Access Layer—Serves to connect hosts to the infrastructure, providing network access, typically at Layer 2 (L2) (i.e., LANs or VLANs).''

% The goal of load balancing system is to provide optimal resource, e.g. central processing units, memory, or storage, utilization and desired performance metrics, usually maximal throughput, minimizing response time, and avoiding congestion and overloading parts of the system.

% Traditional web server load balancing algorithms are not sufficient for the large scale and distinct structure of so-called service-oriented data centers.

\section{Virtualization}
\label{section:virtualization}
\todo[inline]{What is virtualization? Why is virtualization used? How does it change (complicate) the way things (i.e. routing etc) is done?}

Virtualization is an act of dividing physical computing resources, for example central processing units, memory, or storage, into a multiple execution environments.

Snapshot of a virtual machine describes the state of the machine at a certain point of time. Storing a snapshot of a virtual machine allows the machine to be shut and restarted again with possibly exact state.

Snapshot of a virtual machine can be migrated into another physical host.

\section{Evolved Packet Core}
\label{section:evolved-packet-core}

The main components of Evolved Packet Core are
  - Home Subscriber Server (HSS)
    HSS contains the information about the network subscribers
  - Packet Data Network Gateway (P-Gw)
    P-GW works as the communicator between the EPC and the core networks (PDNs).
    uses SGi interface
    PDN's are identified by an access point name (APN).
  - Serving gateway (S-GW)
    the router which forwards data between the base station and P-GW
  - Mobility Management Entity (MME)
    signals messages and utilizes Home Subscriber Server (HSS) to control the high-level operations of the mobile
  - Policy Control and Charding Rules Function (PCRF)
    PCRF responsibility is to handle the policy control decisions, and charging functionality in the Policy Control Enforcement Function (PCEF) inside P-GW

HSS:
Home Subscriber Server database has two main function. It contains information related to the network users and subscribers. Its second function is to provide support functions in mobility management, call and session setup, user authentication and access authorization. HSS is based on Home Location Register (HLR) and Authentication center (AuC).

\subsection{EPC protocols}
\label{sec:epc-protocols}
S1AP [http://www.codenomicon.com/products/defensics/datasheets/s1ap-server-suite.html]:
S1AP is the control plane signalling protocol between E-UTRAN and Evolved Packet Core. S1AP uses S1-MME interface, which is located between eNodeB and the MME. S1AP functions can be divided into two categories: UE associated services and non UE associated services. UE associated services relate to a single UE, whereas the non UE associated services is comprised of all the other S1-MME interface related services.

S1AP is transferred over SCTP protocol, and is defined in TS 36.413.

S1AP/NAS:
S1AP protocol offers NAS signal transport, which enables transport functionality between UE and MME. The NAS protocol enables the mobility- and session management between the UE and MME. NAS is defined in the TS 24.301.

DIAMETER:
Diameter is the base protocol for authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) in EPS, which can be extended to provide AAA services for different access technologies.
