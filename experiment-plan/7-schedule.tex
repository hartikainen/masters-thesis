    Week 26 (past) & Figuring out why the hardware setup loses packets \\
    Week 27 (past) & Still debugging the packet loss problem. Contacted Krister from Nokia, but haven\t hear back from him. Figuring out how the Octeon perf-counter work, coding some initial examples \\
    Week 28 & Measure the loopback time through the blade, possibly several blades. Use different packet sizes: x, y, z. Do the measurements first using MPAC, and after that use the perf-counters. Measure the latencies of the packet generator simply by sending packets to itself. Create initial PSE model of the setup. \\
    Week 29 & Figure out the packet loss problem, start variating the packet data. Start measuring the intar-node latencies \\
    Week 30 & Vacation \\
