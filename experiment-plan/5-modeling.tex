The model will be created by iterative modeling-measurement-configuration approach.

The workload for the model will be chosen so that it brings out the real-life characteristics of the load-balancing. The software is modeled using OpenEM type, event based, processing where the inter-blade communication and load-balancing is implemented using for example future-promise or MPI type synchronization constructs. The hardware model will be created based on the network processing device described above.
