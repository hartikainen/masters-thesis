The goal of this experiment is to study the performance of a network processing system consisting of multiple network processing units. We want to understand what kind of computation is possible with such a system and its suitability as stream computing platform. We hope to understand how event driven programming models, such as OpenEM, could be extended to support inter-node load balancing in stream computation context.

We need to measure and understand the delays of the processing pipeline. The most crucial is to understand the communication delays between the blades, but also the memory latencies needs to be understood.

The system will be modeled by using the in-house PSE simulation tool. One of the goals is to gain further understanding about the tool, and further develop it.
