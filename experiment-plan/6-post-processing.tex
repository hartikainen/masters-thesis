the post-processing means validation and verification of the created simulation model, and planning the next steps according to those results. The simulations ran with the model has to produce similar effects as the real system under study. The precision of the simulation model will be measured both qualitatively and quantitatively.

After validation and verification, we will either reiterate the measurement and modeling phase, or conclude the experiment and present the results in the thesis.
